		<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
		<p class="emphasis">
			All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with
			the following code of conduct.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone,
			regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
			race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants
			in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
			including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants
			violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of
			the conference organisers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation,
			disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
			deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
			disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
			attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
			immediately.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not
			use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers)
			should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised
			environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action
			they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no
			refund.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
			concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be
			identified as theyâ€™ll be wearing the conference t-shirts.
		</p>
		<p>
			Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local
			police, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for
			the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
		</p>
		<p class="emphasis">
			We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and
			conference-related social events.
