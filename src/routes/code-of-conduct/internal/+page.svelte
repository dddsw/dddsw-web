		<h2>Warnings</h2>
        <p>
            Any member of conference staff can issue a verbal warning to a participant that their behaviour violates the conference's anti-harassment policy. Warnings should be reported to conference committee members as soon as practical. The report should include: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant</li>
            <li>The time you issued the warning</li>
            <li>The behaviour that was in violation</li>
            <li>The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time of warning)</li>
            <li>The circumstances surrounding the incident</li>
            <li>Your identity</li>
            <li>Other people involved in the incident</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Presentations</h2>
        <p>
            Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or minor problems, although a member of conference staff should speak to the presenter afterward. However, staff should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop any presentation or event that repeatedly or seriously violates the anti-harassment policy. For example, simply say "I'm sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time" with no further explanation.
        </p>
        <h2>Taking reports</h2>
        <p>
            When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record what they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid making specific promises about what actions the organizers will take. Ask for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if they are reluctant. Even if the report lacks important details such as the identity of the person taking the harassing actions, it should still be recorded and passed along to the appropriate staff member(s). If the reporter desires it, arrange for an escort by conference staff or a trusted person, contact a friend, and contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the reporter to take any action if they do not want to do it. Respect the reporter's privacy by not sharing unnecessary details with others, especially individuals who were not involved with the situation or non-staff members. 
        </p>
        <h2>Expulsion</h2>
        <p>
            A participant may be expelled by the decision of any of the above listed entities for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A second offence resulting in a warning from staff</li>
            <li>Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction</li>
            <li>A pattern of harassing behaviour, with or without warnings</li>
            <li>A single serious offence (e.g., punching or groping someone, taking up-skirt photos)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Public statements</h2>
        <p>
            As a general rule, conference staff should not make any public statements about the behaviour of individual people during or after the conference.

            In general, consult with other staff members when possible but act when necessary.
        </p>
