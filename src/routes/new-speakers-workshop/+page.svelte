		</div>
		<p>
			Speaking in front of an audience can be daunting - but it doesn't have to be. This workshop will show you how to create and deliver great technical talks, whether you're speaking at industry conferences, doing a talk at your local meetup group, or just sharing ideas with your own team.<br/><br/>
			
			During the first part of the workshop, you'll learn how to design a talk; how to gather ideas, create a structure, and develop your material to suit a particular format or time limit. You'll learn how to use humour and storytelling to connect with your audience, and tips to help you use rehearsal effectively.<br/><br/>
			
			The afternoon session will focus on visual material - slides, multimedia, and live demos. We'll look at techniques you can use to make your presentations clear, accessible and engaging, and how to use images, animation and photography to support and reinforce the points you're making in your presentation. We'll look at tips for presenting code, the challenges of doing live demos, and how to use screen recording and video editing to take your live code presentations to the next level.<br/><br/>
